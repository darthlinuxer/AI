you know we alsoÂ Â have popular libraries like pytorch tensorflowÂ \nJSX which is a Google library then we have someÂ Â formats like GGUF which is a format used forÂ \nLkama models and Keras is another big LibraryÂ Â so we&#39;re going to pick something here that weÂ \nknow how to use or we want to learn how to useÂ Â uh for for starters let&#39;s pick Transformers andÂ \nthen we can sort here on the on the right sideÂ Â for trending or most downloads and open oneÂ \nof these models will will give us informationÂ Â about the model let&#39;s speak one that I know itÂ \nwill work in my

data).\n\nIn this video, we'll learn 6 ways to run various open-source large language models locally.\n\nðŸ”— Useful links:\nI tried 7 ChatGPT alternatives: https://youtu.be/Fd_su8OamSE\nHow to train

I&#39;m doingÂ Â well how about you so this is basically the modelÂ \nis running using python uh tensor flow and theÂ Â Transformer library from um from high in face asÂ \nyou can see to use this you really need to codeÂ Â the behavior because Hugging Face only providesÂ \nthe the the the part um that deals with the modelÂ Â how to start how to encode and decode the dataÂ \nbut maybe of the model of the of the applicationÂ Â you need you need to code it you need to developÂ \nit in your application so regarding hanging faceÂ Â Transformers we can find the pros is that uh itÂ \nhandles the model downloaded automatically andÂ Â we have Snippets in the hanging face side toÂ \nto use the models it&#39;s the best thing we haveÂ Â for experimenting and learning about machineÂ \nlearning and

so let&#39;s seeÂ Â if it works and should this is not a chat it justÂ \ngoing to reply to my question which is what isÂ Â encephalography so after about 10 or 20 secondsÂ \nwe have the answer uh and it&#39;s working so we canÂ Â use this uh to build uh our chat application soÂ \nthe so LangChain successfully accessed the modelÂ Â from Hugging Face and that uh means it&#39;s workingÂ \nand with this is the start obviously we can use aÂ Â lot of more tools um that Lang chain you providesÂ \nto build a very complex application with lots ofÂ Â features but this is uh the basis for running

you canÂ Â focus on the logic of the application but youÂ \nstill need to develop the application uh theÂ Â cons is the same as Transformers because uh it&#39;sÂ \nas slow compared to other Alternatives we&#39;ll seeÂ Â later it&#39;s still running on python so you stillÂ \nneed a good machine to run a model locally soÂ Â so the third uh way of running a local llm isÂ \nwith Llama CPP this uh it&#39;s support of LlamaÂ Â models from Facebooks and meta that run on CNÂ \nC++ and they we are going to see that thereÂ Â are most performant they they run bigger modelsÂ \non smaller Hardware I&#39;m able to run uh a biggerÂ Â model in this laptop something that I couldn&#39;t doÂ \nwith Hugging Face for example or lunching so hereÂ Â we have a basically an a Very optimized

data).\n\nIn this video, we'll learn 6 ways to run various open-source large language models locally.\n\nðŸ”— Useful links:\nI tried 7 ChatGPT alternatives: https://youtu.be/Fd_su8OamSE\nHow to train

one youÂ Â have in Facebook and you need to request accessÂ \nyou know and that takes a couple of days uh butÂ Â uh if we don&#39;t want to do that there&#39;s also a fewÂ \nmodels out there uploaded by individuals um we canÂ Â pick for example um this one Lama uh Lama 2 7Â \nbillion parameters and it&#39;s in GGUF uh you canÂ Â see here in file versions the uh model files thereÂ \nare different uh types of models the Q comes fromÂ Â quantization so uh it depends on how many bits theÂ \nmodel uses H we can download for testing the lateÂ Â the smallest quantization model and it will takeÂ \na while but once we have that we can execute itÂ Â on our Llama.CPP okay so now now that I have theÂ \nmodel downloaded I can uh use uh DM and call thatÂ Â I have it in my temp file and it&#39;s going

moreÂ \nperformant month we get at the end someÂ Â uh Benchmark about uh time you know and uh soÂ \nit&#39;s very interesting and it allows me to runÂ Â things that I would normally be able to do

modelÂ Â it&#39;s just double clicking and and it installsÂ \na service on your machine and then you openÂ Â a terminal and and just run uh select your modelÂ \nand and run your your prompts and get results youÂ Â know maybe the the you can run Llama and VicuÃ±aÂ \nmodels very easily and it runs really fast H forÂ Â the cons is you do have a limited set of models HÂ \nthere&#39;s uh less models than on Llama CPP currentlyÂ Â maybe that changes in the future uh the otherÂ \nthing is that you can&#39;t manage the models andÂ Â the tool manages downloading the models so uhÂ \nif you already have models downloaded maybe youÂ Â need to download them again there&#39;s not a lot ofÂ \noptions to tweak this is really a tool dedicatedÂ Â to a user uh that isn&#39;t interested in using

If we can replace ChatGPT or Bard with them we would gain a great deal of privacy and use these models in cases we previously couldn't before (like when dealing with sensitive or proprietary data).\n\nIn this video, we'll learn 6 ways to run various open-source large language models locally.\n\nðŸ”— Useful links:\nI tried 7 ChatGPT alternatives: https://youtu.be/Fd_su8OamSE\nHow to train a model using CI/CD: https://youtu.be/6X8BqtmXoVo\nBlog post with examples: https://semaphoreci.com/blog/local-llm\nHuggingFace: https://huggingface.co\nLangChain: https://www.langchain.com\nLlama.cpp: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\nLlamafile: https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile\nOllama: https://ollama.ai\nGPT4ALL: https://gpt4all.io/index.html\n\n\n================================================\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n0:54 Hardware requirements\n2:04 (1) How to use HuggingFace ðŸ¤— and Transformers ðŸ¤–\n8:35 (2) LangChain\n11:58 (3) Llama.cpp\n17:21 (4) Llamafile\n20:39 (5) Ollama.ai\n23:43 (6) GPT4ALL\n27:10 Conclusion\n================================================\n\n#llm #ai #localllm #llama2 #openai #chatgpt #nlp #machinelearning #ml #development #programming #devops #tutorial #llama3","docSource":"https://youtu.be/7jMIsmwocpM?si=Ipw-gE8afVLFpZG7","chunkSource":"link://https://youtu.be/7jMIsmwocpM?si=Ipw-gE8afVLFpZG7","published":"5/13/2024, 6:41:01 PM","wordCount":3967,"token_count_estimate":5655,"text":"will depend on your needs if you want chat GPT uhÂ Â you can use GPT4All which is one of the best onesÂ \naround but if you want to build a project on topÂ Â of a language model you will need something likeÂ \nLLama.CPP or even python if your goal is learningÂ Â machine learning uh you need to Learn PythonÂ \nand use the the libraries for machine learningÂ Â so I hope I made a case for running your own largeÂ \nlanguage model the models are only getting betterÂ Â and I think the gap between uh closed and openÂ \nsource models are getting shorter and smallerÂ Â all the time and especially there&#39;s a a case forÂ \nusing local uh language models because you are inÂ Â total control of your own data that&#39;s all for nowÂ \nI really do want to explore AI in more detail inÂ Â the future so if you have any request feel freeÂ \nto leave a comment if you like this video pleaseÂ Â leave us like And subscribe so you don&#39;t miss theÂ \nnext one thank you for watching and have a niceone"}}]]
